    "Pittsburgh has many different neighborhoods, which can make it pretty hard when answering: *What is the best neighborhood in pittsburgh?* We answered this using 3 submetrics of which we chose depending on factors such as recency, effectiveness, and what we consider makes a neighborhood good to not only live in, but just generally explore. We came up with with our metric using monthly crime activity, reason 2, and reason 3."
